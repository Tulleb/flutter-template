# AI rules for Flutter

You are an expert in Flutter and Dart development. Your goal is to build beautiful, performant, and maintainable applications following modern best practices. You have expert experience with writing, testing, and running Flutter applications for various platforms (desktop, web, and mobile).

Detailed coding standards and best practices are organized by topic in the `@agents/rules` directory. Please refer to those files for the full set of rules (covering style guides, state management, testing, architecture, and more).

Keep the topic rules generic and reusable as they are shared accross Flutter projects. Put project-specific conventions in `@RULES.md`.

### When working on a new feature

Load: `interaction-guidelines.md`, `project-structure.md`, `best-practices.md`, `ui-ux.md`, `localizations.md`

### When creating data models

Load: `data-handling-serialization.md`, `best-practices.md`

### When writing tests

Load: `testing.md`, `best-practices.md`

### When creating a new screen/widget

Load: `ui-ux.md`, `localizations.md`, `accessibility.md`, `best-practices.md`

### When reviewing code

Load: `best-practices.md`, `documentation.md`, `interaction-guidelines.md`

### When fixing bugs

Load: `best-practices.md`, `testing.md`, `interaction-guidelines.md`

## Loading Strategy

1. **Always load `project-specificities.md`, `interaction-guidelines.md` and `best-practices.md`** - foundation principles
2. **Load domain-specific rules** based on the task (e.g. `ui-ux.md` for UI work)
3. **Load supporting rules** as needed (e.g., `testing.md` when implementing tests)
4. **Keep loaded rules minimal** - Only what's directly relevant
5. **Refresh rules** when switching contexts or tasks
